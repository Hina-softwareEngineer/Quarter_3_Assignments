## Async Rust

Rust is the most loving programming language by developers all around the world. When you search on google by writing Rust language, You will see that Grow is written on its name. Rust is the growinng language which remains for next 40 years. 

Rust has roughly same binary as C and C++ language. But Rust guaranteed compile0time with absence of udefined behaviour. Moreover, Rust has other different things

But, the most important reason why i like rust is due to its security and asynchronization. 

## Asynchronization

If you know Javascript well, then you must be know about asynchronization in javascript. 

> Asynchronization is a technique to do multiple tasks simultaneously.

#### Example

In real world, suppose you are cooking you food in the Kitchen. Then, your phone start ringing and you pick up the call. Now, you are doing both cooking and talking on the phone. You do both work simultaneously. This is called Asynchronization.

Again taken the above example, you are cooking the food, your phone starts ringing. But donot pick up the phone. You first complete cooking then pick the phone. Means you first complete your first work then starts doing second work. This is called synchronization. 

I hope that synchronization and asynchronization is now clear to you. 

Now, I will give examples in programming paradigm.
