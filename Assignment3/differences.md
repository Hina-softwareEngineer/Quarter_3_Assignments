# Multi-Threading Vs Multi-Tasking (Async)

Before, I will tell you about the differences between multi-tasking adn multi-threading, I will tell you about what is task and thread?

## Task

In computer, a task means a single application is running. For example, you started paint in windows.

## Thread

Every **task** is done by user  is divided into sub-tasks which are called threads.
For Example, when you run paint, then it has many threads such as paint, draw shapes, etc.
