# Multi-Threading Vs Multi-Tasking (Async)

Before, I will tell you about the differences between multi-tasking adn multi-threading, I will tell you about what is task and thread?

## Task

In computer, a task means a single application is running. For example, you started paint in windows.

## Thread

Every **task** is done by user  is divided into sub-tasks which are called threads.
For Example, when you run paint, then it has many threads such as paint, draw shapes, etc.

> A thread is a sequential flow of control in a program. 

Now, comes to multi-tasking and multi-threading.


## Multi-Tasking

When a user or multiple users runs more than one application at a time, then it is termed as multi-tasking. Whehter you have single processor or multi-processors, multi-tasking is done on both.

Multi-tasking is done by quickly switching between tasks, so that user can use each program together. This makes the performance of user better.

Example : 

Like , you are using Ms Word, Ms Excel and Terminals at a time. This is the example of Multi-Tasking.

## Multi-Threading

When a user runs multiple sub-tasks of multiple-application, then this is called multi-threading. By using Multi-threading, we can inscrease the power of CPU by creating many threads in a process at a time. Multi-threading also provides the same resources and memory to processes as multi-tasking provides. In programming terms ,you can say it Asynchronous Programming.
