    "# What is MicroServices?\n",
    "\n",
    "The evolution of technologies has changed the way of structuring our applications. To develop distributed, more scalable and highly maintainable and testable applications we need microservices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Microservices is a way of structuring an application as loosely coupled and highly cohesive services. It is a small component of application. Each service is maintained and developed individually to avoid complexity in application.To provide communication between services, a module provides a simple interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "To early days of computer science, barriers to entry in programming language were high. Only PhD in computer can use these programming languages. In 1964, a general purpose lanugage **BASIC** was introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "BASIC lowers the barriers in programming. In 1960, there was a fast growth of software applications so software becomes large and complex. To tackle the complexity, **Divide and Conquer** technique was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1972, David Parnas introduced the concept of **Modularity** and **Information Hiding** which reduces complexity and make code reusability which reduces bugs in codes. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modularization\n",
    "\n",
    "Decomposition of large, complex software system into \"Loosely Coupled, Highly Cohedive\" system which communicate via internal simple intrefaces. Here, we need to understand what is meant by Loosely Coupled and Highly Cohesive.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Loosely Coupled\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency between modules should be very low\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Highly cohesive\n",
    "\n",
    "One module should focus on single or similar functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1990s **Layered Application Architecture** was introduced to reduce the complexity of applications due to the rapid spread of internet. Then in 2000s, a **Cambrian Explosion** happens and then software starts eating the world. Then engineers found that Monolithic architecture cannot solve the innovative ideasand fast approach strategy. Then, Microservices were introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Monolithic Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Monolithic Architecture are single service which holds all functionality of your application whehter handling requests, database operations, communication within modules. Applications based on Monolithic Architecture are deployed as single App. Monoliths are layered architecture consists of many layers i.e. Presentation, Business and database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros \n",
    "\n",
    "1- Useful for small Team \n",
    "2- Simple to develop and test\n",
    "3- Monolith Architecture is cheaper\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Lack of Innovation\n",
    "2- tightly coupled system\n",
    "3- Difficult to continuously Deploy\n",
    "4- Not resilient, One bug can crash the whole application\n",
    "5- Fixes bug\n",
    "6- Time consuming\n",
    "\n",
    "## Microservices Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Microservices architecture is the most popular architecture for designing the application. Microservices architecture let you split down your large application into small , interconnected and independent systems. Each microservice works independently on individual and deployed independently. Thus, The software team understands the codebase easily, which increases productivity. Each service has its own database. Hence, simplify the development and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Loosely Coupled \n",
    "2- Higlhly maintainable \n",
    "3- Deployed Independently\n",
    "4- Appropriate Scaling\n",
    "5- Resilient\n",
